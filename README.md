# Project Homelab

A LAN-first, secure, extensible personal cloud and automation hub.

---

## Overview

Homelab is a self-hosted system that provides private user storage, local file sharing, and messaging within a LAN. It’s designed to work entirely offline, with modular components for future extensions like automation, dashboards, and AI helpers.

## Current Progress

### Authentication

- Implemented using JWT access and refresh tokens.

### Storage

- Local file storage and management implemented.
- Users can upload, organize, and manage their own files.
- Data is private — users cannot access each other’s files.

---

## Next Steps

- Local chat (1:1 and broadcast).
- File sharing and permission system.
- Add-on framework for modular features.
